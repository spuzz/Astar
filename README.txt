Multithreaded Astar Algorithm Lib
================================


Overview
----------
Implements the Astar algorithm used for finding the shortest path across over a graph or grid of points.
Using multi threaded implementation to allow increased efficiency as path finding needs to be smooth 
when running in a program trying to run up to 60 fps so that the calculation time is not visible to the user. 


Requirements:
------------------
Visual Studio 2013 


TODO:
Unit Tests to provide thorough testing of efficiency, erroneous input and correct path output
Error handling
Logger for Debugging
Profiling for optimisation


Note:
This lib is still in dev and hasn't been fully tested on separate systems
